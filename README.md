## Project Overview

### Introduction
This project is a web-based **Therapy Appointment Scheduler** designed for multiple user roles:
- **Parents** who manage appointments for their children,
- **Students** who schedule or view their sessions,
- **Doctors** (or Therapists/Tutors) who set availability and manage bookings,
- **Admin** who has elevated privileges for system management.

The application includes:
- A **role-based login system** with secure authentication using JWT tokens.
- A **responsive UI** with real-time validations including email format checking and password visibility toggles.
- A clean, modern, and minimalistic design.

---

## Features

### Role-Based Authentication
- **Registration & Login:**  
  Users register by providing their email (as the username), password, and role (Parent, Therapist/Tutor, or Student). The admin account is preset in the database.
- **Secure Authentication:**  
  Passwords are hashed using bcrypt and JWT tokens are generated upon successful login.
- **Role-Based Navigation:**  
  After login, users are redirected to their respective dashboards based on their role (Parent, Doctor/ Therapist, Student, or Admin).

### User-Friendly Interface
- **Email Format Validation:**  
  The frontend validates the email format (except for the admin user) to ensure valid entries.
- **Password Visibility Toggle:**  
  An eye icon allows users to toggle password visibility while typing.
- **Real-Time Feedback:**  
  Error and success messages are displayed instantly during form submission.

## Dependencies

### Backend (Flask):
- **Flask** â€“ Lightweight web framework
- **Flask-CORS** â€“ For handling cross-origin requests
- **mysql-connector-python** â€“ MySQL database connector
- **Flask-Bcrypt** â€“ For secure password hashing
- **Flask-JWT-Extended** â€“ For JWT-based authentication

### Frontend (React):
- **React** â€“ UI library
- **react-router-dom** â€“ Routing
- **jwt-decode** â€“ To decode JWT tokens
- **axios** or **fetch API** â€“ For HTTP requests (our example uses fetch)

_All these libraries are open source._

### **Steps to Set Up the Project**

#### **Database Setup**

1. **Start MySQL and create the database:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   ```
   Inside MySQL shell, run:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE therapy_clinic;
   USE therapy_clinic;
   ```
   
2. **Run the provided schema file:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p therapy_clinic < database/schema.sql
   ```

#### **Backend Setup**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nubpz/Group4.git
   cd Group4/backend
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Backend Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### **Frontend Setup**

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Folder:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install react react-dom react-router-dom jwt-decode axios
   ```
